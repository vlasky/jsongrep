## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Bounded DFA compilation for untrusted queries:
  `QueryDFA::from_query_bounded`, `from_query_bounded_ignore_case`,
  `from_query_str_bounded`, `from_query_str_bounded_ignore_case`, with new
  error types `StateLimitExceeded` and `QueryCompileError`. Subset
  construction is worst-case exponential; the budget turns a potential
  memory/CPU blowup into a clean "query is too complex" error.
- The `jg` CLI caps query compilation at 2^18 DFA states (a clean error
  after ~0.4 s worst case instead of unbounded time/memory), and the WASM
  playground at 2^16.
- `-r`/`--raw-output`: print matched strings without JSON quotes or escaping
  (like `jq -r`), enabling `VAR=$(... | jg -r field)` shell pipelines.
- Property-based test suite (`tests/properties.rs`, using `proptest`):
  parsing never panics on arbitrary or DSL-alphabet input, every parsed
  query compiles to a DFA without panicking, and `Query` display always
  produces parseable syntax that stabilizes under repeated reparse. These
  properties guard the whole input space behind the display round-trip
  fixes below.

### Fixed

- `/regex/` queries no longer panic: the parser now rejects them with a clean
  "not implemented yet" error (`QueryParseError::UnsupportedFeature`) instead
  of letting DFA construction hit `unimplemented!()` from the CLI, library,
  and WASM playground.
- Array index `[18446744073709551615]` (`usize::MAX`) no longer overflows
  (panic in debug builds, silent wrap in release); it now matches nothing,
  which is correct since an element at that index cannot exist.
- `--porcelain` now does what its help text says for match output too:
  colors are forced off (previously still colored on a TTY) and
  `--compact` is implied, so output is one machine-parseable JSON value
  per line. Previously only the `--count`/`--depth` labels were
  affected.
- `Query` display no longer renders `foo.*` (field then field wildcard) as
  `foo*`, which reparsed as `foo` repeated zero or more times - a different
  query. Likewise `foo*.[0]` no longer renders as `foo*[0]`, which did not
  reparse at all. The `.` separator is now omitted only between a bare field
  and its array access, so displaying and reparsing a query preserves its
  meaning.

- `Query` display now parenthesizes a `?`/`*` operand that itself carries a
  modifier: `(foo?)*` used to display as `foo?*`, which does not reparse
  (the grammar allows one modifier per step). Redundant parentheses around
  a single plain step still collapse (`(foo)?` displays as `foo?`). A
  modifier on an empty operand (reachable via `QueryBuilder::new()
  .optional()`) now displays as the empty query it denotes instead of an
  unparseable bare `?`.
- `Query` display elides sequence elements that display as the empty query
  (the identity of concatenation), instead of emitting unparseable forms
  like `foo..bar` for a hand-built sequence containing an empty
  subsequence.

### Breaking

- `QueryParseError` gains the `UnsupportedFeature` variant and is now
  `#[non_exhaustive]`; downstream exhaustive matches need a wildcard arm.
- `/regex/` query strings now return a parse error instead of parsing
  successfully (and panicking on execution).
- `jsongrep::utils::write_colored_result` now takes a `WriteOptions` struct
  instead of separate `pretty`, `show_path`, and `raw` parameters.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- Interactive WASM playground
  ([#31](https://github.com/micahkepe/jsongrep/pull/31)) &rarr; viewable at
  [https://micahkepe.com/jsongrep/playground/](https://micahkepe.com/jsongrep/playground/)
- `--porcelain` flag &rarr; outputs explicit machine-readable output (mimics
  `git` convention) (#32)

### Changed

- `--count`/ `--depth` are now mutually exclusive
  - Previously, either could be used in combination, but with the addition of
    `--porcelain`, which strips the "Found matches"/"Depth" prefixes from the
    output, the bare count/depth results would be indistinguishable
  - Explicitly makes these options mutually exclusive via `clap`'s
    `conflicts_with` attribute
    provided
- `--count`/ `--depth` now imply `--no-display` &rarr; these options are solely
  for matches and document analysis, do not need display of the results,
  especially for `--depth`, which now does not need a query string.
- `--depth` no longer requires a query string &rarr; sole positional argument is
  treated as the file, e.g., `jg --depth foo.json`

  > [!NOTE]
  > Still maintains backwards compatibility with old invocation `jg --depth "<query>" foo.json`

### Breaking

- BREAKING CHANGE: `--count`/ `--depth` are now **mutually exclusive**
- BREAKING CHANGE: `jsongrep::query::QueryEngine` marked as deprecated, prefer
  `QueryDFA::find` directly.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-03-30

### Fixed

- Range query upper bound silently ignored &rarr; `[1:3]` behaved as `[1:]`
  ([#27](https://github.com/micahkepe/jsongrep/issues/27))
- `[:n]` range queries parsed incorrectly due to ambiguous pest grammar;
  replaced with explicit `range_start`/`range_end` sub-rules
- Missing Kleene star in `QueryBuilder` example

### Added

- winget installation instructions (`winget install jsongrep`)
- Parser tests for all range query variants (`[m:n]`, `[m:]`, `[:n]`, `[:]`)

### Changed

- `documentation` and `keywords` entries added to `Cargo.toml` metadata

## [0.8.0] - 2026-03-28

### Added

- Multi-format input support via `-f` / `--format` flag: YAML, TOML,
  JSONL/NDJSON, CBOR, and MessagePack
- Auto-detection of input format from file extension (`.yaml`, `.yml`, `.toml`,
  `.jsonl`, `.ndjson`, `.cbor`, `.msgpack`, `.mp`)
- Feature flags for optional format dependencies (`yaml`, `toml`, `cbor`,
  `msgpack`), all enabled by default via `all-formats`
- JSONL/NDJSON support with no extra dependencies &rarr; lines are wrapped into a
  JSON array where array indices map to line numbers
- `Display` impl for `Format` enum for user-facing error messages
- Homebrew formula auto-bump workflow on release
- CI: `--no-default-features` build check and `cargo fmt --check`

### Changed

- Project description updated to reflect multi-format support
- `all-formats` is now the default feature set &rarr; `cargo install jsongrep`
  includes all format support out of the box
- README rewritten: added Multi-Format Input section, fixed `jq` comparison
  wording, noted Homebrew auto-installs completions and man pages

## [0.7.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- `-i` / `--ignore-case` flag for case-insensitive field name matching
- `QueryDFA::from_query_ignore_case` and `QueryDFA::from_query_str_ignore_case`
  public API methods for building case-insensitive DFAs
- Criterion benchmark suite comparing `jsongrep` against `jsonpath-rust`,
  `jmespath`, `jaq`, and `jql` across four benchmark groups (document parse,
  query compile, query search, end-to-end)
- XLarge benchmark tier using citylots.json (190 MB GeoJSON) for real-world
  scale testing
- `just bench-download` recipe to fetch `citylots.json` for XLarge benchmark
- `just bench-publish` recipe to publish Criterion HTML reports to gh-pages
  (orphaned branch)

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-15

### Added

- `-F` / `--fixed-string` CLI flag that treats the query as a literal field name
  and searches at any depth (equivalent to `(* | [*])*."<literal>"`)
- `--with-path` / `--no-path` flags for controlling path header display
- TTY-aware path header suppression: headers are shown when output is a
  terminal and hidden when piped, following ripgrep conventions

### Fixed

- Quoted field names with special characters (e.g., `/endpoint`) now correctly
  round-trip through parsing, escaping, and matching
- Don't display root path in colorized output - no longer prints `:` when
  no query is provided (e.g, `cat data.json | jg ""`)
- `jg generate man` now correctly prefixes all subcommand man pages with
  `jg-` (e.g., `jg-generate-shell.1` instead of `generate-shell.1`)
- `jg generate man` now overwrites existing man pages instead of failing
  with `AlreadyExists`, making version upgrades seamless

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: `jsongrep::utils::write_colored_result` now takes a
  `show_path: bool` parameter to control path header display
- Updated README usage examples to reflect `-F` flag and current output format
- Updated README with more examples and comparisons to `jq`

## [0.5.1] - 2026-02-14

### Fixed

- Updated README examples to reflect the new path-prefixed output format
- Updated library dependency version in README from `0.3` to `0.5`

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-14

### Added

- Syntax-highlighted JSON output using the `colored` crate — keys in cyan,
  strings in green, numbers in yellow, Booleans in bold yellow, null in
  dimmed red
- Each query result now displays its matched JSON path as a colored header
  (e.g., `prizes.[4].laureates.[1]:`) above the value
- `Display` impl for `PathType` for human-readable path rendering
- New `utils` module with `write_colored_result` for colorized output and
  `depth()` (moved from `lib.rs`)

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: CLI output format changed from a single JSON array of all
  results to individual values, each preceded by its matched path. Scripts
  parsing the old `[...]` array output will need updating.
- **BREAKING**: `jsongrep::depth()` moved to `jsongrep::utils::depth()`
- `PathType` is now publicly re-exported from the `query` module
- Input parsing extracted into `parse_input_content` function
- Output uses a single locked `BufWriter<Stdout>` with explicit flush

### Fixed

- Broken pipe errors when piping to `less` or `head` are now silently
  handled instead of printing an error

## [0.4.1] - 2026-02-01

### Added

- `field!` macro for constructing field queries (e.g., `field!("foo")` =>
  `Query::Field("foo".to_string())`)
- `Query::field` method for constructing field queries from type `T: Into<String>`
  for convenience (e.g., `Query::field("foo")`)

### Fixed

- Fixed incorrect example query in README

## [0.4.0] - 2026-02-01

### Changed

- Removed `tokenizer` module from public API (was unused)

### Documentation

## [0.3.0] - 2025-11-21

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Migrated from custom `JSONValue` type to `serde_json::Value` for
  better compatibility with the Rust ecosystem
- **BREAKING**: Removed custom `schema` module (JSON schema validation
  functionality)
- Simplified JSON handling by leveraging `serde_json` directly
- Updated all query engine implementations to work with `serde_json::Value`

### Fixed

- Fixed JSON parsing in CLI to properly parse input files instead of wrapping
  them as strings

### Internal

- Refactored test utilities to use `serde_json::Map` instead of `HashMap`
- Moved `depth()` function from `JSONValue` method to standalone function in `lib.rs`
- Cleaned up type conversions throughout the codebase
